8 algorithms for working with graphs.

There are implemented 8 algorithms:
  1. Graph traversal - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  2. Graph traversal - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  3. Prim's algorithm for building a minimal spanning tree
  4. Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths
  5. Algorithm A* for finding the shortest paths
  6. Ford-Falkerson algorithm for finding the maximum flow
  7. Dijkstra's two-way algorithm for finding potential friends
     social network
   8. Two-way algorithm A* for finding a unique path to
      transport network â€” tests on proposed data
  
  File points_coordinates.txt contains the number of each point and it's coordinates (x,y)
  
  File edges contains the list of the edges in format: number of first point, number of second point, weight of the edge
  
You need a freeglut lib to run the project
